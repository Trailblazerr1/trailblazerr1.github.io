## [Personal website](https://anuragk.com/)

This is a small static profile page without any dependencies apart from vanilla HTML and CSS.     
Whole website is made under 300 lines of HTML and CSS code.        
It's small, simple and works!                             
               
Linkblog based on similar template: https://anuragk.com/linkblog/

*I've used LLMs to generate comments and refactor the code.*      
    
## TODO

    - [ ] Fix box and readme link on homepage.
    - [ ] Add a new /projects page, to showcase all project.(Make new projects too.)
